- Keep in mind that this launcher is unstable. If you found any unexpected errors/bugs,
please check your `console` and report it at [Issues](https://github.com/GoodDay360/Tempest-Launccher/issues).
- This program certification isn't entirely associated with Microsoft yet, so Windows Defender/Antivirus might delete the file. Turn off Window Defender/Antivirus if the program isn't working, or you can add Tempest Launcher to Window Defender [Exclusions](https://github.com/GoodDay360/Tempest-Launcher/wiki/Tempest-Launcher-Wiki#add-tempest-launcher-to-window-defender-exclusions).
